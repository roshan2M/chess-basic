# chess-basic

This is a chess game made in my Grade 11 Computer Science class using Ready to Program Java IDE. This was slightly different than writing a game in regular Java since it only involved the use of one class. All the graphics, inputs, and calculations had to be handled within this class. I broke up the code into many smaller methods to handle individual tasks.

This chess game (ChessBasic) has most of the features as a regular chess game, but leaves out some of the complicated features. For example, it was difficult for me to find check, checkmate, or stalemate patterns. Thus, I modified the rules of the game so that once the king was captured, the game would end. Also, the board would be much simpler, as it consisted of pawns, rooks and kings (due to time constraints).

I also plan to publish a full-fledged chess game with all features included (in Java). I would also like to make a simple chess engine that can play decently against a player. To run this program, you cannot use regular Java, but need to download the Ready to Program Java IDE, since this IDE uses consoles to run properly.
